## 2026-07-11 (session 27) — Login bounce fix, Google popup, Profile/Settings merge, Help refresh

**🔴 P0 — "Login successful but stuck on login page" (iPhone, intermittent) — FIXED**
- Root cause (found via DigitalOcean prod RUN logs for the iPhone attempt): `POST /api/user/login → 200`
  (token issued server-side), the dashboard chunk loaded, then a **full-document** `GET /auth/login`
  (referer /dashboard) fired with **zero** authenticated API calls in between. i.e. `withAuth`
  (wrapping `ClientLayout`) read `localStorage.getItem("token")` as **null** on the freshly-loaded
  dashboard and redirected — an iOS Safari/Chrome localStorage write-visibility race right after the
  client-side SPA navigation.
- Fix: `Components/Page/Common/HOC/withAuth.tsx` — on first mount, retry the token check up to
  8× / 120ms (~960ms grace) and also react to cross-tab `storage` writes before redirecting to
  `/auth/login`. Hardened `pages/auth/login.tsx` post-login nav to only `router.replace("/dashboard")`
  once the token is confirmed in localStorage.
- Verified (Playwright + minted JWT): logged-in `/dashboard` stays put; logged-out `/dashboard`
  still redirects to `/auth/login`.

**Google sign-in stays on the SAME page (no "new page")**
- `pages/auth/login.tsx`: `handleGoogleLogin` now always uses the Google Identity Services popup
  token flow, briefly polling (≤2.5s) for the async GIS script to load, and **removed the
  `signIn("google")` full-page-redirect fallback** (that was the "new page"). Removed now-unused
  `next-auth/react` `signIn` import. Verified: clicking Google keeps URL on `/auth/login` and opens
  a popup.

**🟠 P1 — Profile & Settings consolidated**
- `/profile` now permanently client-redirects to `/settings?section=profile` (`pages/profile.tsx`).
- Removed the redundant "Profile" item from the desktop `UserMenu`; repointed the mobile
  `Header` drawer and legacy `Sidebar` profile links to `/settings?section=profile`.
- Verified: `/profile` → `/settings?section=profile` renders the Profile & Security section.

**Help & Support refresh + Chat CTA**
- `Components/Page/HelpAndSupport/index.tsx`: replaced hardcoded `#4F46E5`/fixed-px widths with
  theme-driven, responsive CSS-grid layout (article cards + search). Added a "Chat with us" primary
  CTA that dispatches `dynopay:open-support-chat` to open the existing AI support widget, alongside
  an "Email us" card. Verified: CTA opens `support-chat-panel`.

**Not a code change**
- GitHub authorize-screen logo is set in the user's GitHub OAuth App settings (they will upload it).
